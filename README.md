# PingIT
Ping Tool to Ping up to 80 Computers and report the IP.


Copy the Code.  Open Powershell ISE as an Administrator.  Paste the Code and Run.

We needed a way to track IP address changes for a project we were working on and thought this could be handy for others.  Load Your devices into a text file 1 device per line, and it will ping a host every 2 seconds until it completes the list and starts over.
